## Player Companion Types

There are different types of companions which unique abilities.

### Collector

The collector collects automatic items in a specific radius in his own inventory.
You can access the inventory like a normal chest.

### Companion (wip)

The companion is a combination of the collector, follower and guard and has some additional features like text lines.

### Follower

Is more like a cosmetic mob which will follow you around the world.

### Guard

The guard will protected you from hostile mobs and will attack any target you are attacking.
Equip your guard with weapons and armor to deal more damage and to have a better protection.

### Healer

The healer companion heals any player and your own companions in a specific radius.
Additional healer will stack up the effect, so if you are traveling with your friends it good to have 1-2 healers in the group.

### Supporter

The supporter companions gives buffs to any player and your own companions in a specific radius.
Additional supporter will not stack up, but they will be able to buff the whole group.

## Spawn

The player companions are automatically spawned in specific biomes, but could be also spawned over the specific items in the creative mode.
